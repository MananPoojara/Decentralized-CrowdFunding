# Decentralized-CrowdFunding
  Decentralized crowdfunding, also known as decentralized finance (DeFi) crowdfunding, leverages blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and fundraising without the need for intermediaries. It enables trustless and transparent crowdfunding, allowing participants to directly engage in fundraising activities.
